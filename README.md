# Sound Bouquet
Audio sample manager, metadata manager and batch editor for quick editing of large sample packs. Written in C# with the .NET framework. 

## Roadmap

This is a solo project. It will take a long time to develop and will help me deepen my knowledge of .NET developemnt and audio programming along the way. Currently work is being done on the specification and prototyping aspects of things. As a stepping stone to developing this application, other middleware needs to be developed, to interface with the file formats that I want to support (first priority is given to WAV, AIFF and FLAC; second priority to MP3 and OGG Vorbis)

A rough outline of the milestones are as follows:
